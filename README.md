# Onedseven

A Dungeons & Dragons role-playing board game club has a lacation to play games. This web application will help to establish interaction between players and game masters. Masters will be able to book rooms for games using the calendar, give a brief description, add images, number of seats, price, and so on. And players will be able to book a place for this game, choose a character file for the game, and communicate in the game chat.
